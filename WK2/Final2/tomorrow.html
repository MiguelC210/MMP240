        <h1>Tomorrowland</h1>
        <p>Tomorrowland is an electronic dance music festival held in Boom, Belgium. Tomorrowland was first held in 2005 and has since become one of the world's largest and most notable music festivals. It now stretches over 2 weekends and usually sells out in minutes.</p>
        <h2>The Essentials</h2>
        <p>Smartphone, Fanny pack, Camelbak, BabyWipes, Gum, External Cell Phone Charger, Sunglasses, and Sunscreen.</p>
        <h2>Tickets Information</h2>
        <p>First and foremost tickets are an essential part to attending Tomorrowland (surprising I know).  Tomorrowland tickets have a reputation of selling out within the hour, and general admission tickets going within a couple of minutes. So it is crucial to have all your bases covered when trying to purchase. Whether it be that you recruit friends and family on different computers around the house to help you purchase as soon as the tickets are on sale, or whether you pay a little bit extra and go for more expensive options that don't sell out as fast.</p>
        <h2>Staying Hydrated</h2>
        <p>This is an important one and the one that will either make or break your weekend; STAY HYDRATED the last thing you need is to be carted off due to dehydration. 
Pro Tip - Bring bottle caps into the festival with you, all bottle caps are taken off the water bottles inside the grounds for security and safety reasons. Just so you can refill your water at any of the bathroom taps and keep it in your bag for duration of the night. Or better yet take an empty camel back in with you, no point filling it up before you go through security as they will ask you to empty it anyway.</p>

        <h1>Ultra Music Festival</h1>
        <p>Ultra Music Festival is an annual outdoor electronic music festival that takes place during March in Miami, Florida, United States. The festival was founded in 1999 by Russell Faibisch and Alex Omes and is named after the 1997 Depeche Mode album, Ultra.

It was first held on Miami Beach, but besides a tenure at Bicentennial Park, it had primarily been held at Bayfront Park in downtown Miami. It was a one-day festival from 1999 to 2006. In 2019, the festival will move to Virginia Key, a barrier island in the Miami area.

Since 2011, Ultra has taken place across three days (Friday through Sunday) during the month of March. In 2012, a record attendance of 155,000 people attended the festival. In 2013, for the first time in Ultra’s history, the festival took place across two consecutive weekends welcoming a combined attendance of 330,000 people. In 2014, the festival returned to its original one weekend format, selling out pre sale tickets in under five minutes. The most recent edition of Ultra, in 2017, welcomed 165,000 people to the festival.

Although they share names, Ultra Music Festival was not directly tied to Ultra Records, an electronic music record label. However, the two entities did announce a "global alliance" in August 2012, which would allow them to collaborate on marketing and cross-promotion.

Alongside the flagship event in Miami, Ultra has spawned a larger series of international franchises under the blanket branding Ultra Worldwide, which have included locations such as South Africa, South Korea, Singapore, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia, and others.</p>
        <h2>The Essentials</h2>
        <p>Smartphone, Fanny pack, Camelbak, BabyWipes, Gum, External Cell Phone Charger, Sunglasses, and Sunscreen.</p>
        <h2>When to Arrive</h2>
        <p>Gates were scheduled to open at 4 PM on Friday of Ultra Music Festival 2014 but the lines were forming well in advance. Eager ravers wrapped around the block and tensions grew high on the first Friday as they pushed the open back nearly a half hour for undisclosed reasons. I was fortunate enough to get down there around noon, squeeze in line with some friends, and sneak right in at 4:30 but I was in the minority. Those at the front told me they had been waiting upwards of 5 hours. Gates are scheduled to open at 12 PM on Saturday and Sunday. Once the gates opened and people got moving the flow was pretty consistent. It all depends on the artists you are most excited to see. I recommend getting there as early as possible. This allows you to scope out the venue, establish meeting spots, catch some sick up-and-coming producers, and get a feel for the grounds. After all, that is what the festival experience is all about – soaking it all in.

Not to mention the undiscovered talent that plays during the day. People seem to have the common perception that just because you are playing earlier in the day means you are sub-par. Remember fellow fest heads, this is Ultra Music Festival. Every producer that takes the stage is oozing talent and mad skills.

I left Ultra Music Festival 2014 with so much newly discovered talent and tracks that it took me months to bring my iPod up to speed. Regardless of when you decide to arrive, be sure to pace yourselves. This is a sprint, not a marathon.</p>
        <h2>Staying Hydrated</h2>
        <p>Be sure to drink enough water. Water runs $5 a bottle but is well worth it, and necessary. In addition to purchasing bottles, water dispensers are available throughout the festival grounds. If it comes down to it, you can even approach the first-aid tent and politely ask for a bottle of water. As long as you are decent about it, chances are the medics will provide you with one. Worst case scenario, if you are feeling dehydrated mention it to the staff and they will not turn you away. I strongly recommend investing in a Camelbak, especially if you plan on being in the middle of the madness.</p>

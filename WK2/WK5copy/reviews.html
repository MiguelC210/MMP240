    <h1>Reviews From Our Satisfied Customers:</h1>
      <h2>Dom V.</h2>
        <p>Luigi made my day! Chose this spot because it was short walking distance of my hotel. Was visiting from Florida. The cashier Joe recommenced 2 cheese slices. I got one with extra cheese. The pizza was so tasty! Was crispy, yet soft. Prices were beautiful and restaurant had a nice feel. As a Chicago native, I must say this was some good pizza. Almost as good as the Chicago style.</p>
      <h2>Elysa O.</h2>
        <p>Best pizzeria in the neighborhood by the court building and Prudential. Always fresh! The place has plenty of selections of different pies and plenty of seats for patrons. They organize the lunch rush by setting up areas to order certain type of meals, such as the pizza line, hot food line, and sandwich line. Your wait isn't that long, which is great since it's located in a busy business area. I've been to other pizzerias in the area and this is hands down the best one!</p>
      <h2>Miguel C.</h2>
        <p>Luigi’s Pizzeria appeals to two types of crowds: Pizza lovers, and homemade / healthy eaters. Luigi likes to maintain his store organized and clean so that families can come in and feel it like home. Luigi’s Pizzeria is fun, fresh, healthy, competitive, and unique.</p>
